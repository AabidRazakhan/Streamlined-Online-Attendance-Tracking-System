Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                        Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works. This license is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it is
free software for all its users. This General Public License applies to
most of the Free Software Foundation’s software and to any other program
whose authors commit to using it. (Some other software is covered by the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs,
and that you are informed that you can do these things.

Accordingly, the GPL imposes the following restrictions on the
distribution of modified versions of the Program:

   0. Definitions.

   This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
   under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
   refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
   means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
   that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
   either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as
   "you".

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
   of works, such as semiconductors.

   "The Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making
   modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
   documentation source, and configuration files.

   "The Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not
   limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and
   conversions to other media types.

   "You" means an individual or legal entity exercising permissions
   granted by this License. "Your" has a corresponding meaning.

   "The Licensor" means the copyright owner or entity authorized by
   the copyright owner that is granting the License.

   "The Contribution" means the original program or work and any
   additions to or changes to that program or work.

   "The GNU General Public License" means this license, which allows
   for the distribution of software under certain conditions.

   "The GNU Lesser General Public License" means the license under
   which certain versions of the software may be distributed.

   "The Free Software Foundation" is a non-profit organization that
   promotes free software.

   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
   conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
   copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
   notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
   and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
   along with the Program.

   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
   of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
   distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
   above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
   whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
   thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
   under the terms of this License.

   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
   when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
   interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
   announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
   that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty)
   and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,
   and telling the user how to obtain a copy of this License.

   3. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
   except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
   to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program is void, and
   will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

   4. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore,
   by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
   and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
   the Program or works based on it.

   5. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute, or modify the Program subject
   to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
   this License.

   6. If you distribute a modified version of the Program you must
   include a copy of this License along with the modified version.
   You must also include a prominent notice stating that you have changed
   the Program.

   7. The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
   program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine
   library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
   applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use
   the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.

   8. This License is intended to be the authoritative license for
   this Program. If you have questions about this License or
   interpretation of this License, please refer to the Free Software
   Foundation.

   9. If you have any questions about this License, you can reach
   the Free Software Foundation at <https://fsf.org/>.

   10. The GNU General Public License is in the public domain, and
   therefore it may be copied, modified, and distributed freely
   without restrictions.
